## funkyfuzz

`FunkyFuzz` is a medium-level web vulnerability scanner designed for security researchers, bug bounty hunters, and web penetration testers. It combines crawling, XSS/HTML injection detection, and sensitive file discovery into one easy-to-use tool.

## âœ¨ Features
- Web Crawling: Recursively explores target websites, respecting same-origin by default, with optional subdomain crawling.

- XSS & HTML Injection Detection: Injects payloads into query parameters and forms to detect reflected vulnerabilities.

- Sensitive File Discovery: Checks for exposed sensitive paths and files like .env, .git/, wp-config.php, robots.txt, and more.

- Reporting: Generates both machine-readable JSON and human-friendly HTML reports, including summaries and direct links to vulnerable URLs.

- Configurable: Supports async requests, concurrency, and page crawl limits for flexible scanning.
